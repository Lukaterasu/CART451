           <h3>Week 9 Reading Response - One of Refik Anadol’s works</h3> <br><br>


One of Refik Anadol’s works that I found particularly interesting is his <i>Machine Hallucinations - Space</i>  series. This is an NFT collection inspired by space exploration. Anadol uses artificial intelligence to analyze space photography and create speculations/visualizations of the unknown from these images. His dataset was two million raw images provided by the International Space Station. <br><br>

The combination of space exploration, AI, and digital art makes for an extremely intriguing work. The endless possibilities of space exploration were translated into an animated graphic, which created an environment unlike any other. The only words I can use to describe the experience are Surreal, Hypnotizing, Mysterious, and Alluring. Not only was <i>Machine Hallucinations - Space</i> pleasing to the eye, but makes the user realize their place. Our problems, passions, aspirations,  and hobbies won’t create a single ripple in the universe. This realization, although bitter, is also quite calming. 
<br><br>
Another reason I liked this artwork is because it is an NFT collection. Without going into too much detail, I am a big fan of NFTs because they empower artists. Not only do they protect us from copyright theft and fraud, but they also allow us to make money without the use of third parties (labels, publishers, exhibitions, etc). Although NFTs are still new to the world, works such as Anadol’s Machine Hallucinations - Space will show people their potential. <br><br>
