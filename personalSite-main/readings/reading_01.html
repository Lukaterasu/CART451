            <h3>Response to Jeff Howe's "The Rise Of Crowdsourcing" (Wired, 2006)</h3>
            <p>One of the main topics in Jeff Howe’s "The Rise Of Crowdsourcing" article is that early companies who used crowdsourcing as opposed to traditional methods gained significant advantages over competitors. One interesting example is the emergence of stock image websites. Initially, companies would pay photographers a couple of hundred dollars per image. However, with the emergence of crowdsourcing, companies like <i>iStockphoto</i> appeared. These businesses would gather thousands of photos from various photographers and make them available to the public at a minimal price. For obvious reasons, this new service created lots of demand which left freelance photographers, like Mark Harmel, at a loss. "The Rise Of Crowdsourcing" mentions several other examples of how early crowdsourcing became a “revolutionary” business model.

                This power of crowdsourcing directly relates to the article “Wikipedia – an unplanned miracle” by Clay Shirky. Wikipedia is another crowdsourcing service that skyrocketed in popularity. According to the article, the services started as a small-scale online encyclopedia with one particular feature: users could add information as they pleased, without any permission. This “gimmick” rapidly grew as many people started adding information to the website. With each edit, Wikipedia’s content got a little bit better, and fast forward 20 years, Wikipedia is the most popular “information” website. The crowdsourcing aspect of Wikipedia is an undeniable reason for its success. Not only did it allow the creation of thousands of expertly written pages, but also permitted the information to be accessible to all.
